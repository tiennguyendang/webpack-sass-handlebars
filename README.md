# Webpack Sass Handlebars Boilerplate

This project uses Sass for styling, Handlebars for templates and Webpack for bundling

## Styling

Using the [7-1 architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) pattern and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) writing conventions

Folder structure

- `base/`
- `components/`
- `layout/`
- `pages/`
- `themes/`
- `abstracts/`
- `vendors/`
- `main.scss` (root level)

The `vendors` folder also includes `bootstrap-grid` that help to build responsive layout.
